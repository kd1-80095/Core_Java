/*
 Create a class called Employee that includes three fields—a first name (type String), a last
name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three
instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary
is not positive, do not set its value. Write a test application named EmployeeTest that demonstrates
class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary.
Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.
